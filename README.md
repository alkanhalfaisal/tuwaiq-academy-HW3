**stander input and output**


It is a way to communicate between the user and the program 
there are three input and output connections
1-standard input: where the user tries to enter input to the program
2- standard output: after some operations are done by the program the way to transfer the result of those operations is either to print it as output in debug console or in a widget 
3-standard error: it occurs when there are any syntax error or any other type of errors
